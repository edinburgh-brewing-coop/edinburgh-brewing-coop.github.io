The Edinburgh Brewing Cooperative is a project to create a cooperative
brewery in Edinburgh involving Samuel Heron, James Kerr, Euan Kidston and
Gavin Gray.  In the process we're going to do some thinking about what
exactly a cooperative is or ought to be (probably collating the thoughts of
many people on the topic) and brew some really good beer. Posts on this
website are about both of these things.
