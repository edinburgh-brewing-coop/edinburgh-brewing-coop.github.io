Our first order! They were unspecific however, so we elected to brew a Best Bitter for November's Students for Cooperation conference.

Grain Bill
==========

Mashed the following:

* 72.5% Pale Two-Row (7kg)
* 25% Torrefied Wheat (1kg)
* 5% Medium Crystal 60L (1kg)
* 5% Dark Crystal 80L (0.5kg)
* 5% Vienna (0.25kg)

Sparged up to 50L.

Boil
====

Boiled for 90 minutes, with the following fun additions:

* 60mins 20g First Gold (7.61AA)
* 30mins 30g First Gold (7.61AA)
* 20mins 75g Progress (6.65AA)
* 10mins 50g Goldings (3.43AA)

Resulted in ~43L, a bit less than expected. Should be enough for two cornelious kegs and some spare to keep for ourselves.

Post-Boil
=========

Two batches, roughly equal, were fermented separately with different yeasts. 

Yeasts:
* Edinburgh Scottish Ale Yeast (WLP028)
* London Ale Yeast (WLP013)

Original Gravity: 1.050.
