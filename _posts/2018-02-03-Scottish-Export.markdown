For our first brew of the year, and with the IDB Homebrew Competition coming up we decided to indulge our interest in local beer history by brewing a Scottish Export or 80- as its also known.

The grist was partly inspired by historical Scottish beers of the 19th century, however we ended up deciding on a ratio that favoured Baird's heritage crystal malt and threw in some brown malt for good measure. We originally wanted to put in 5% wheat however a mix up on the day led to us using 5% unmalted barley which ended up imparting a dry flavour we hadn't planned for, but worked out quite nicely in the end.

We split the batch into two and fermented one with a traditional Edinburgh ale yeast and then chucked a Belgian abbey yeast into the other half to riff off of the Scottish influence in Belgian Ale. The unmalted barley's dryness didn't work quite so well for this as the yeasts attenuation was somewhat lower leading to an odd syrup-y dryness.
