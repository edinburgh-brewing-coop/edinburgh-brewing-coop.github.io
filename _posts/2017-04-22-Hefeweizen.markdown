With the summer coming up we decided to brew something good to drink in the hopeful event of sunshine in Edinburgh. We'd not done a Hef before so thought now'd be a good time. Due to it being the season, we also made this our first experiment proper with cherry addition and aging.

Grain Bill
==========

- 0.5kg Acid Malt
- 6.5kg Wheat Malt
- 2kg CaraHell
- 0.5kg Melanoidin
- 1kg Spelt Malt

Mashed for an hour at 65C

Liquor to Grist: 2.5 : 1 (Approx.)

Boil
====

Boiled for 90 minutes, with the following fun additions:

- 60 min: 20g Perle (7.1AA)
- 30 min: 10g Perle (7.1AA)
- 10 min: 50g Hallertauer Mittelfruh (2.8AA)
- 1 min/end: 50g Hallertauer Mittelfruh (2.8AA)

Post-Boil
=========

Due to a miscalculation we ended up with a little more of this than planned and so with a lower OG.

Yeast
-----

Hefeweizen Yeast

- OG: 1.034
- FG: 1.0085
- ABV: 3.34%

Cherry Version
--------------

9 Litres with 2Kg Spanish Cherries, frozen, defrosted, crushed.

Final Gravity after 1 month in FV = 1.007

Result
======

Unhampered by a lower ABV, this was delicious. The cherry version turned out great, a pale red with a nice but not rich cherry flavour.
