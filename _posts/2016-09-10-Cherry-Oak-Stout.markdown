Brewing milestone! With today's brew, we have ceased to be one-pan brewers. No more will we tip out into a bucket between mash and boil whilst we clean the same pan to be used again. Today we have become three-pan brewers. We also say goodbye to our brewer's blanket/an old duvet that kept our mash insulated, since we can now use a properly insulated pan.

Our new era begins with a double-sized (for us) batch of Cherry Oak Stout, to be later split and half Bretted.

It also began with mild alarm. We hadn't started heating water on a new burner for even ten minutes before we noticed an unusual smell. We were fortunately able to rule out this being due to a butane leak after referencing the Scout's safety guide (one of the top search results for gas safety, and top-tip: the only resource we could easily find with any real detail on the subject).

Grain Bill
==========

* 7 Kg Pale Ale Malt - 2 Row

Meanwhile:

* 900g Cherries left to soak in:
* 70cl Ten Year Old Kirsch/Cherry Liquer

After mash sparged up to 40l!

Boiled for 120 minutes, adding the following:
