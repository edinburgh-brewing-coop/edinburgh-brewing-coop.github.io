__Interesting anecdote from our recent time in Belgium pending__.

Grain Bill
==========

Mashed at 68Â°C for 60 minutes with the following:

* 3.4kg Pale 2-Row Malt
* 1kg Brown Malt
* 0.3kg Dark Crystal
* 0.25kg Aromatic Malt
* 0.25kg Golden Naked Oats

After mash sparged up to a bit over 23l.

Boil/Splitting the Goods
========================

At point of boil, split 8L from the pot to be soured for a few days by Lactobacillus Delbrueckii.

Boiled the remainder for 90 minutes.

Our first plan was to use Galena, possibly Colombus hops. But as luck would have it, our Brewstore were selling 4 year and very pungent Fuggles; aged in store having been acquired after the closure of another homebrew shop in town some years ago. 36 grams was added to the remainder at 60 minutes. At 30 minutes, another 30 grams.

After separating into 3 demijohns:
* The dregs of a Strawberry Lambik (Hansson's), WildBeer's summer 2015 Blend, and a small bottle of Cantillon (Raspberry): added to ~4L
* French Saison yeast, taken from our own ongoing batch of Scotlandsdricka: added to ~4L
* Flemish Ale Blend yeast, again taken from last week's Scotlandsdricka: added to ~4L

Original Gravity

OG 1.059 (hope to end: 1.010)

But Wait
========

Will moniter this experiment over the next few months and report back the results.
