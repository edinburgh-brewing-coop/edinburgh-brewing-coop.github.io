Brown ale is an old style, from when kilning was not an exact thing, and no
one split hairs over exactly how burnt their malt got. So some brown ales
were
browner than others. People don't like to be surprised, so at some point
brown ales died out.

But, now they're back, and maybe their not _exactly_ the same. Maybe
American brown ales have more hops than the traditional styles. That's one
inspiration; good hoppy American brown ales.

Inspiration number two comes from one of the most iconic brown ales:
Newcastle Brown Ale. In their brewing process, the final brown ale is made
by blending a strong and weak ale that has fermented separately. That
seems like a good trick to get consistent results, so we're going to do
that too.

The American recipe we were mostly building from was that of the [mad
fermentationist][mad], but we've deviated quite a bit.

Grain Bill
==========

* 3.3kg pale malt
* 400g Crystal malt
* 300g golden oats
* 550g brown malt

Mash
====

We heated 11.4l of water to 76.2°C and mashed for 1 hour and 20 minutes.
Careful, at this point, because this is where we separate the wort.

Sparge
======

We Sparged up to 20l of water at 76°C after separating the first 4l into
another container. 

After sparging we checked the gravity in the small (4l) container and found
it was 1.093, while the larger (20l) was 1.034. From now on, going to refer
to the small as the __strong__ part and the larger as the __weak__ part.

At this point we took 1l from the strong and put it into the weak, then
took 1l from the weak, after letting it mix, and put it into the strong.
After doing this, the strong was at 1.076 and the weak was at 1.035.

Boil
====

We boiled for one hour, for both the strong and weak. We used the following
hop schedule:

* Weak:
    * 20g Centennial at 60 minutes
    * 20g Centennial at 10 minutes
    * 20g Centennial at 0 minutes
* Strong:
    * 13g Centennial at 60 minutes
    * 13g Centennial at 10 minutes
    * 13g Centennial at 0 minutes

Pitching the Yeast
==================

AFter the boil cooled to 25°C we checked the gravity again:

* Weak OG: 1.038
* Strong OG: 1.090

Into the strong we pitched a WLP001 California Ale Yeast, and into the weak
we pitched a dried american ale yeast sachet.

However, the dried yeast didn't really get going, so after a couple of
days took a sample from the strong (which was fermenting well) and made a
starter with some spray malt in a 2l container. After a day that was
fermenting well so pitched it into the weak bucket. Then, the weak began
fermenting properly.

Dry Hopping
===========

Twelve days after starting, we racked both into new fermenters and Chinook
to both for dry hopping:

* Weak: 20g Chinook
* Strong: 13g Chinook

Blending
========

We took samples of the beer after 9 days and made mixtures in varying
proportions of weak to strong, from 0% to 40% strong in 10% graduations.
Then, we blindfolded James and got him to grade each, being supplied in a
random order (and giving him some twice).

Then, we just tasted them and discussed. Finally, decided that it would be
best to go for a mixture of 20% strong to 80% weak. Given that the final
gravity for the weak was 1.016 and the strong finished at 1.041 this means
that the final estimate for ABV is approximately 3.6%. After blending the
weak and strong together we bottled it with 60g of priming sugar.
