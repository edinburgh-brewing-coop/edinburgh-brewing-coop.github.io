After sampling some of our previous chang 1 year on, and it being absolutely delicious, we decided to do another. As the process to make it is reasonably simple we decided to be extra ambitious and make it during a regular brew day (whilst doing the Sichuan IPA!). This went pretty well.

Grain Bill
==========

For this chang we decided to use some more interesting and whole grain rice so we went for red and black varieties to see the colour would impart well on the chang. We used twice the weight to compensate for the added rice husks and hopefully to make a little more.

- 1kg Thai Black Glutinous Rice
- 1kg Thai Red Rice

Boil
=======

Rice was boiled until cooked.

Post-Boil
=========

Rice was layed out in a thin layer on a sterile surface to cool, after which yeast and Aspergillus Orzae from a dried yeast cake was massaged into the mass and the mass transferred into a fermentor.

Yeast
-----

Unknown Sacchromyces grown with Aspergillus Orzae on ginger root and dried, purchased from Chinese supermarket.

- OG: Indeterminable

Result
======

The result was a lovely tasting chang with a deep purple hue (thus we named it after the man in purple). Though we got only 3410ml, ~600ml more than using half the quantity of white rice.
