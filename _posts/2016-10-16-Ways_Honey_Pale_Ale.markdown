In light of a tasting of Dugges' imperial stout that was split into a number of curated batches, each taken on by a member of staff, we elected to try something similar. We brewed a base pale ale with NZ hops and then gave 5l to each of our 4 main brewers, as we have a larger brew length than that we left the rest as a nice NZ pale ale. The only aim for each was to create something unique involving honey.
