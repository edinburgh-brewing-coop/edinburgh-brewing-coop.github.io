__Interesting historical description pending__.

Grain Bill
==========

Mashed at 65.5°C for 90 minutes with the following:

* 4.5kg Pale Ale Malt
* 0.7kg Amber Malt
* 0.5kg Brown Malt
* 0.3kg Doublge Roasted Crystal

Added these salts to the mash:

* 9g Gypsum
* 5g Calcium Chloride

After mash sparged up to 25l.

Boil
====

Boiled for 120 minutes, adding the following:

* 1.5kg Coopers Amber Amlt Extract at 120min
* Whitbread Goldings Variety (30 IBU) at 60 mins
* Irish Moss at 15 mins
* Whitbread Goldings Variety (10 IBU) at 15 mins
* Styrian Goldings Bobek (0 IBU)

After the boil cooled to 20°C and pitched Edinburgh Ale Yeast (WLP028) and
Burton Ale Yeast (WLP023).

Original Gravity was 1.090 at this point, slightly lower than expected.

Final gravity was 1.028, meaning that the final ABV was 8.5% at bottling.
