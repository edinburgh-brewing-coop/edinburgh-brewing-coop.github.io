In March this year we went down to the Cat Asylum brewery in Collingham near Lincoln to brew a collaborative beer with Henry Bealby. 

This beer is inspired by a dark mild brewed by the Barclay Perkins brewery in 1890; we took the original recipe but adapted it to use modern grain and hop varieties. The single X in the name denotes that this was both a weaker mild, the more X’s the stronger, and also that it was not meant to be aged; in which case K’s would typically be used in place of X’s.

This recipe is unusual for the time and today for the large quantity of brown malt(!), something used sparingly (usually 5-10%) since the advent of cheap pale malt in the mid 19th century. Also unusual for today is the large quantity of maize and use of invert sugars, the former for flavour character finish and the latter for colour and cheaper fermentable sugars. Though given the quantity of brown malt, the sugar may have originally been included for sugar and flavour purposes.
