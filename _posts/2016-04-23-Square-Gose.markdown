So we've generally been a fan of the recently revived 'Gose' style of salty coriander wheat beer and its savoury tastes. As such
we decided that a natural marriage to a savoury beer would be the umami flavour enhancer MSG, which is highly present in kombu
seaweed. As a final touch we thought to balance out the kombu flavour with citrus and so added some seville orange marmalade.
What a flavour menagerie.
