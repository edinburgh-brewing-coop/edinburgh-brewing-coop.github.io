Having a great interest in traditional brew herbs, we were very pleased to finally get our hands on some bog myrtle, a traditional Scottish and northern european brew herb. Bog myrtle was originally used as a bittering agent and flavourant however is tough to get a hold of in dried form due its heavy regulation by the EU as a result of its mild medicinal properties; as such it must be harvested fresh and dried for use. For this beer we took 5l after the mash from the Voss Kveik Dark Mild and then performed a separate boil in parallel with the bog myrtle as we had only enough for this amount.
